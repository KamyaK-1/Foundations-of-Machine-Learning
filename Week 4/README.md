For the final project we will be working on the MNIST dataset. You will train a neural network to recognize a set of handwritten digits. Here are some reference videos for your help. Feel free to import any library as required. You can import MNIST dataset directly by adding this to your code 

```from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist ```

```(X_train, y_train), (_, _) = mnist.load_data()```
