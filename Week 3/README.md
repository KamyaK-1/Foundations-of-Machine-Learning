# Linear and Logistic Regression
Before we learn about full-fledged neural networks, we will understand one of the most fundamental machine learning techniques - regression.

## Resources
The resources for this week will be the [online course on Supervised Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera by Andrew NG. It is highly recommended that you complete all the video tutorials asap.
You do not need to enrol for the course, you can audit all the content for free.

You might find the videos slow, so feel free to watch them at a faster speed.


## Assignment 
Learning to implement logistic regression from scratch fosters a deeper understanding of the algorithm's mechanics, parameter optimization using gradient descent and model evaluation.

For this week's assignment, you will build a gradient descent model that predicts the chance of having Heart Disease on this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression).
